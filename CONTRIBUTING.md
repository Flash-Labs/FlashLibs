# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Before making a contribution,
please review the following guidelines.

First, we ask that before starting you discuss the changes either through an
issue, on [Discord](https://discord.gg/jZpxUrD), or through another method. This
is to ensure we know what is currently being worked on to help us administrate
the project effectively. When in doubt, create an issue for discussion first.

The following resources are also useful for understanding the standards for this
project and expectations for participating in the community.

## Contribution Methods

There are many ways you can contribute, even if you're not a developer, such as:

 - Creating or commenting on issues
 - Creating or reviewing pull requests
 - Updating the documentation
 - Assisting with beta testing
 - Providing support through Discord

Note 'cosmetic' changes like reformatting or fixing typos are not accepted. See
[this explanation](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/13771#issuecomment-32746700)
on the rails repository for why these can be detrimental to a project.

Feel free to reach out to a team member if you're not sure how to start! We're
always happy to help and we want to encourage community collaboration.

## Creating a Pull Request

A pull request (PR) is a process for merging changes from a separate repository
into the main one here. The following steps can be used to create a PR:

 - Fork the repository though the fork button in the top-right on GitHub
 - Create a new branch for your changes through GitHub or on a local repository
 - Make your changes and test them accordingly (unit tests and manual)
 - Commit your changes to the repo through git (pushing if local)
 - Create a PR from the new branch to this repo (often suggested by GitHub)

Please keep PRs to a single topic. Merging is all or nothing, so PRs containing
multiple features will take longer and are less likely to be merged.

Additionally, PRs which introduce breaking changes are generally discouraged as
these only occur with major versions and often spawn from internal discussion.
